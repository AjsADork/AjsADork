Hello! My name is Gracie, I work in IT as a bench tech (fixing computers) and I aspire to be a pen tester!  
She/Her

I'm interested in code, ethical hacking/pen testing, cybersec, art, gaming, making games, and much more!  
I’m currently learning GML, C#, pen testing, and game making.  
I’m looking to collaborate on anything I may be interested in (I am not a very good programmer tho XD).

Fun fact: The name “ferret” is from the Latin word furittus which means “little thief” in Latin.

How to reach me: ajdork47@gmail.com
